    &lt;p&gt;As climbers, we all know that the flat overhand knot, or Euro Death Knot (EDK), is preferred over the double fisherman’s bend when joining ropes for a long rappel because its flat profile makes it much less likely to get snagged when pulling the rope. We also know that we should make sure to have 30 - 50cm of tail in the knot because it slips under tension, and we don’t want it to come undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen any data to back that up?
I haven’t, and after discussing this recently I thought it would be interesting to perform some pull tests to see how this stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going any further I should be very clear that this is &lt;strong&gt;not conclusive&lt;/strong&gt;. This was two tests of two scenarios, performed &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;. It’s impossible to draw conclusions from this of all ropes, and knots tied, dressed and set in all different ways. Personally, I will still be using 30-50cm tails when I rap on an EDK, but I’ll be much less concerned about the length of the tails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loads were measured using a Rock Exotica enForcer load cell, running at two samples per second;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One end of the load cell was attached to an anchor constructed of 4 strands of 25mm tube tape;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The other end of the load cell was attached to one of the ropes being tested using a bowline;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second rope being tested was attached to an 8:1 mechanical advantage system (a compound system of three 2:1 systems), again using a bowline;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximum load was applied for at least 10 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2020-edk/test.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020-edk/test-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2020-edk/haul.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2020-edk/haul-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Backyard testing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To “set” a knot is to hand-tighten it. The usual way of doing this is to hold the knot in one hand, and with the other pull each of the four strands in turn, repeating until the knot is firm and the tails no longer move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bear in mind that this shows the results from &lt;strong&gt;a single test&lt;/strong&gt; of four different scenarios. It would be inappropriate and unsafe to draw conclusions from this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A key reason for this is that I’ve been tying knots in a particular way for 20 years. Your method of dressing and setting knots, or your rope, could have wildly different results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s “kgf”?&lt;/strong&gt; kN are a measure of force, kg are a measure of mass. &lt;em&gt;kgf&lt;/em&gt; is a common notation to represent &lt;em&gt;a force equivalent to this many kilograms&lt;/em&gt;. You can read this as kg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s a clear Spring afternoon. Warmer than you expected, especially after the terrifying move you just pulled off. But you managed to stick it, and with clammy hands that are a little bit shaky you reach the top of pitch 4, build a quick anchor and shout &lt;em&gt;“In hard!”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Leaving the rope until your second is ready you reach around, take your ATC off your harness, and&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ding … ding … ding ding …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“Below”&lt;/em&gt; You shout, immediately followed by &lt;em&gt;“Shit!”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us have been in this situation before. And it’s one of several reasons that everyone who works or plays on rope should know the Münter Hitch and its big brother the Super Münter (aka Monster Münter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-1-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-2-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Münter Hitch from both sides&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This fabulous little hitch can be used to belay a climber, as a progress capture in a haul system, to abseil, to lower a load (think rescue or recovery), on single or double rope, and can be comfortably used to hold a load up to about 150kg. It inverts on the carabiner, so you can use either strand as the load (or haul) strand and it automatically adjusts. The down side is that it twists the rope, so it’s not time to just toss your ATC in the bin I’m afraid.
All you need to be able to use it is a carabiner - preferably a HMS shape. This actually stands for &lt;em&gt;HalbMastwurf Sicherung&lt;/em&gt;, which means ‘Münter Hitch belay’ in German. HMS carabiners exist specifically to be used with Münter hitches. Another fun fact, the German word &lt;em&gt;HalbMastwurf&lt;/em&gt; above means ‘half clove hitch’, and that’s exactly what the Münter hitch is - A clove hitch cut in half lengthways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-3-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-4-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;A half twist to the tail in my fingers turns the Münter hitch (L) into a clove hitch (R)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve come across dozens of different ways to tie a Münter hitch. Most of them involve complicated sequences of forming loops and pretending you’re holding a book. Forget all that. Just take your rope and make a loop. Doesn’t matter which way around it is, just any old loop.
Now take one of the lines coming out of the loop - again, it doesn’t matter which one - and fold it over the other length of rope and back onto itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-5-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-6-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-7-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, take your carabiner and attach it to whichever two sections of rope are running next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-8.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-8-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check that it’s tied correctly by pulling each leg in turn and checking that the knot inverts and pays out in both directions, and you’re done. Use as you would any friction device except, where most friction devices use “thumb up your bum” (rope pulled away from the carabiner back toward the abseiler or anchor) as the position with the highest friction, with a Münter hitch this is the position with the lowest friction. The most friction is achieved when the tail is parallel with the loaded rope.
Best practice is to have the tail on the spine side of the carabiner rather than the gate side to avoid cross-loading and potentially opening the gate on your (even tri-lock) carabiner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-9.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-9-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-10.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-10-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Left: High friction position. Right: Low friction position&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The most effective way to lock the hitch in place so you can go hands-free or leave it unattended is with a slipped half-hitch and overhand. This combination is such a ubiquitous method for locking Münter hitches that it’s also called a Münter Mule.
First, form a bight of rope from the tail. Wrap it around the loaded rope and then through the loop this forms. This is your slipped half hitch. You can adjust the size of the bight now so it’s big enough to tie the overhand. Give yourself a nice, big bight before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-11.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-11-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-12.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-12-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-13.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-13-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;(L) Form a bight (M) Tie a half hitch (R) Make the bight nice and big&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, wrap the bight around the loaded rope and back through itself as shown below. You want the bight tied from outside in and it should run more or less parallel with the loaded rope. If your bight pokes from the inside out, or points off to the side, you’ve probably tied a second half hitch rather than an overhand knot. You can try again, or just tie a third half hitch and call it safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-14.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-14-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-15.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-15-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-16-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Finishing the Münter Mule&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The finished product should be tidy and compact. To lower the rope undo the overhand knot, shorten the bight on the slipped half hitch and then, while holding tension on the tail of the rope loosen the half hitch and slowly untie it, remembering that you’re now carrying whatever’s attached to the other end of the Münter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-17.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-17-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;The finished product&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a big load - or a long drop - you can use a Monster Münter (aka Super Münter). This bad boy can easily be used for a 300kg load, and the second twist it adds to the rope cancels out the original twist, so it won’t twist your rope at all.
Hold the tail so that it forms a second loop around the loaded rope and clip the tail through the carabiner so that the new loop is pulled into the loaded rope when under tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-18.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-18-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-19.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-19-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-20.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-munter/munter-20-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Tying a Monster Münter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When we last met we were taking a helicopter out of Plateau Hut, returning to Unwin Lodge about a week ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we didn’t take any photos of the wineries (of which there were many), but this is an oveview of some of the other things we filled our time with in the ensuing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been walking and climbing in Aoraki/Mt. Cook National Park &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/summer-2014-tramping-nz/&quot;&gt;less than twelve months ago&lt;/a&gt;, we could easily have spent the entire time there. However the weather Gods would not abide it (and we would have been subjected to a diet of oats, lentils and rice leftover from the mountains for much of the time), so we chose just a small number of walks and a little climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mueller-hut&quot;&gt;Mueller Hut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With impending weather due to hit we walked up to Mueller Hut as a morning trip. A future trip staying out there - or climbing from there - could be worth considering, but it seemed a destination we had to check off our bucket list.
We had a perfect morning for it so I donned what were to become my trusty mountain sandals and off we went up 423,509 steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/mueller-2015.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos of our walk to Mueller Hut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;climbing-at-sebastapol&quot;&gt;Climbing at Sebastapol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking to Mueller Hut we spent a fabulous afternoon climbing the routes at Unwin Crag, a few hundred metres from Unwin Lodge. We’ve climbed these before but they’re fun climbs in a great position, and before long we’re joined by two other people staying at Unwin Lodge and we start chatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They turn out to be Rachel and Scott, two West Australian climbers. Scott looks familiar and it turns out he was in Plateau Hut with us, part of an AC mountaineering skills course (there were well over 20 people in the hut).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening Unwin Lodge is full of people returning from Plateau Hut and we hear stories and see photos of their climbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we sneak in a quick climb at Sebastapol Bluffs “before the weather comes in” and I bail on my first climb ever, a slabby run out 17 in the rain. I’ll never get that biner back…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there it’s on to Wanaka via Cromwell wineries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-matukituki-valley&quot;&gt;The Matukituki Valley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Summer’s walk out of &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/aspiring-national-park/&quot;&gt;Aspiring National Park&lt;/a&gt; through the Matukituki Valley was awe-inspiring and Wendy is excited to see it. With a couple of days of mostly good weather we plan to walk into Aspiring Hut, do a day walk from there depending on conditions (there’s been a significant amount of rain, so climbing ridgelines to huts may not be the wisest choice of route), and walk out to finish our trip in Queenstown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we set out from Raspberry Creek carpark (the start of the walk) we bump into Rachel and Scott, who are returning from doing exactly what we’d planned (not such a surprise - we’d recommended it to them before leaving Unwin Lodge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-matukituki/matukituki-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Meeting near the Rob Roy Glacier track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk is lovely, as is the company - I reunite with Donald, the hut warden at Aspiring Hut, and he tells us about a new track opened in the past week that replaces the old track to the top of the valley and the Bonar Glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/matukituki-2015.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos of our walk up the Matukituki Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With unending rain at higher altitudes that seems an excellent way to spend a day and we become some of the first people to walk the new Upper Matukituki Valley track. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;/images/2015-matukituki/New_Upper_Matukituki_Valley_Track.gpx&quot;&gt;GPS route of the new track here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Topographic map of the new track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A (very) large commercial hiking group joins us in the afternoon and we wonder at their guide, who is the noisiest of the bunch, drinks more shots of whisky than the rest, and plays harmonica late into the night. We escape at first light and move on to Queenstown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gorge-road-crag&quot;&gt;Gorge Road Crag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I’d talked about climbing at Gorge Rd and had been talked out of it by Brendan, but it seems like a good place to get a morning climb in Queenstown. We arrive and are racking up at the car when some other climbers return to the carpark. I say hi with my head still in the back of my car and hear “&lt;em&gt;Chris?!&lt;/em&gt;”. Turning around I see Jono and we chat for a while, making tentative plans that never eventuate to climb the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, the climbing at Gorge Road is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An extraordinarily-busy November included two weddings, working in three different cities and various climbing and canyoning trips.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the midst of this Wendy and I managed to pack and &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; prepare for a trip into Aoraki/Mt. Cook National Park. With a few peaks in our sights we’d like three good-weather days, so plan on spending about a week at Plateau Hut followed by two days walking down via Ball Shelter back to the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sunday-december-6&quot;&gt;Sunday, December 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fly out of Sydney around lunch time. While waiting to board I’m contacted by the helicopter company to ask if I’d like to join a back flight at 8.30am the next day. The timing is tight but achievable, and it will save us a few hundred dollars, so we go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Queenstown mid-afternoon we pick up our hire car and buy two weeks of food before setting out for Aoraki/Mt. Cook and reaching the comfort of Unwin Lodge around 9.30pm. While packing our gear for the flight the following morning we discover that our dorm-mate is also hoping to fly into Plateau Hut the following day but hasn’t booked a flight and make plans to share the flight with his party and bring the cost down to only about $100 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday-december-7&quot;&gt;Monday, December 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 10am we’ve set up our home in Plateau Hut for the week and begin discussing plans for the day. While unpacking we bump into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justonestep.eu&quot;&gt;Gabriel&lt;/a&gt;, who Brittany and I were stuck in Colin Todd Hut with for a few days the previous Summer, and we discuss plans with him. He gives us beta on Mt. Dixon (don’t bother, it’s a choice between large, broken bergschrund and overhead cerac that could rain down blocks of ice at any moment).
The weather couldn’t be better so we use the slopes of Glacier Dome for Wendy to practice self arrest and then continue for a walk around the Grand Plateau to investigate the approach to Mt. Dixon ourselves and see if we can find a safe way up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Wendy gearing up for glacier travel outside Plateau Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mt. Dixon looks feasible but unlikely - Traveling under the cerac is out of the question (ice was falling while we were looking), but we could &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; cross the schrund to the right and traverse above it to reach the start of the climb. Probably. So this is probably a trip for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt. Dixon. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t think to take a photo until we were quite far from it. Usual access is the snow ramp to the ridgeline on the right&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;A better shot taken two days later. The conditions are harder to see from this angle, but the appeal of the mountain is much clearer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of a walk around the Grand Plateau and some further self arrest practice ends our day when I get cold fingers and become desparate for the warmth of the hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Wendy hanging out in front of Aoraki (left) and Silberhorn (right)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday-december-8&quot;&gt;Tuesday, December 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday dawns another perfect day and we plan to climb the Anzac Peaks and assess the route to Mt. Malaspina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I pull out my camera to take a photo of Wendy negotiating the crevasse field of the Grand Plateau at the beginning of the day to find flat batteries, so we have no photos of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk to Anzac Peaks is tougher than expected for both of us (so much steep terrain!), but it provides an excellent view of the approach to Malaspina. Maybe I’m a little over-conservative about these things, but the entire route looks remarkably like an avalanche magnet (Side note: We bumped in Jono again in Queenstown and he agreed that it can be very avalanchey). Our candidate climbs are becoming fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anzac Peaks proved a great introduction to alpine climbing for Wendy, and a fun day for me. We followed the line of least resistance to the top, then found a more challenging route and ascended a second time to give Wendy (and me!) a chance to climb some steep snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;The Anzac Peaks. Taken from Plateau Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned to the hut after a fun, successful and more tiring than expected day. I returned last Summer with ambitions to start running again which were only partly achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday-december-9&quot;&gt;Wednesday, December 9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Glacier Dome. The fun route follows the major snow ramp, then the smaller ramp to the left and finally the rock and snow right of that to the summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agree that Dixon is out, so today we will climb Glacier Dome. It’s another bluebell day (our third in a row; remember we’d anticipated spending a week in the hut in order to get three good days?) but I sleep in until 8.30am. I’ve been feeling the effects of the past year since leaving the city and have done little other than eat and sleep while we’ve been in the hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually get underway and before long are lamenting steep walking and pining to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Long and steep - Our hut is the red dot in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Steep enough to rope up now&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Climbing properly at last!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final pitch becomes mixed climbing on rock protection (which is excellent), and the rock is even sound enough in some places for cams to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Wendy making her way up the final pitch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;We even got some top roping photos of me when I refused to leave a stuck nut behind and went back to recover it after Wendy had given up trying to remove it&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-aoraki/aoraki-12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;(I got the nut, although it has a few more scratches and deformations on it now)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the hut we met another party who had walked up our planned descent route and asked them about it. “&lt;em&gt;Scariest thing I’ve ever done in my life&lt;/em&gt;” responds one of them. These people were on Mt. Cook this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consensus around the hut seems to be that foot access was fine a few decades ago, but the Boys Glacier has changed a lot recently and access is now difficult, dangerous, unstable and not very scenic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And so we found some people to share a helicopter with and flew out a few hours later - A week ahead of schedule and leaving ample time for tramping, rock climbing, and visiting wineries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My 10 year-old Airport Express kicked the bucket last week. I’ve been hoping this day would come for about a year, so I’ve now replaced one of the digital arms of my stereo system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that don’t know, my stereo is my pride and joy. It consumes near-endless amounts of time and money, and when we recently moved to Sydney the biggest decision in setting up our new home was how to configure the living area for optimal accoustics (a matter of literally weeks of consideration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new digital source would fit into my system alongside a &lt;em&gt;Musical Fidelity Tri Vista 21&lt;/em&gt; tube DAC, &lt;em&gt;Denon PMA 2010&lt;/em&gt; integrated amplifier and homemade transmission line speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criteria for the new component was something that supported AirPlay - how I play most of my music. 99% of the time music is to simply enjoy, not to sit down and critically listen to, so optimising audio quality isn’t key here (my turntable is there for when I want the best). That said, AirPlay &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a bit-perfect algorithm and 16-bit/44.1KHz. Also supporting DLNA/UPnP would be a bonus (bit-perfect at 24-bit/192KHz), but a bit more annoying to drive from a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lots of reading and chatting with people in store I ended up with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridgeaudio.com/products/cx/cxn&quot;&gt;Cambridge Audio CXN Network Player&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; alt=&quot;Cambridge Audio CXN Network Player&quot; src=&quot;/images/cxn.gif&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Cambridge Audio CXN Network Player&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has Spotify support and thousands of Internet Radio stations built in and I’ve suddenly become hooked on them (so many ’90s stations to choose from!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the differential Wolfson DACs that it uses for D-A conversion are excellent - I’ve always put my digital sources through the bespoke DAC for much, much better performance, including far outshining a pretty good Marantz CD player, but there is no longer a clear-cut winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazz, blues, and anything with an empty background is still cleaner and crisper through the tube DAC, but metal in particular is noticeably clearer and shows better separation using the CXN’s internal DACs - Maybe that colouration from the tubes??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, an amazing purchase and, as with any new purchase, it has me appreciating not just my music collection anew but this time the world’s music collection anew thanks to Spotify and Internet Radio.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.137:4000/posts/new-digital-stereo-source/&quot;&gt;New Digital Stereo Source&lt;/a&gt; was originally published by Chris Bennetts-Cash at &lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.0.137:4000&quot;&gt;BENNETTSCASH&lt;/a&gt; on November 01, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been interested in custom and open-source router firmware since the early noughties, when Linksys and NetComm began using GPL  components and subsequently were required to publish their source code, and did so in an incredibly-difficult-to-compile manner.
On and off over the past couple of years I’ve looked at DD-WRT and OpenWRT, two of the more popular open source router firmware distributions, but never had a compelling reason to mess with them. The passage of the Metadata Retention Act into Australia, I think, changes that and makes encapsulating everything I do in a VPN much more compelling. Since I’ll be messing with router settings anyway, why not mess properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-bother&quot;&gt;Why bother?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer used to be &lt;em&gt;“because you can”&lt;/em&gt;. When Linksys first published the source code for their firmware it took the world by storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, let me rephrase. It took the Linux-using, free software-loving portion of the software development community by storm. But, you know, that’s still pretty significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time it was little more than an enforced release because they were using some GPL’d libraries (and my half-hearted attempts to even get it to compile were fruitless).  But over time cleverer people and cross compilers put together &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dd-wrt.com&quot;&gt;DD-WRT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openwrt.org&quot;&gt;OpenWRT&lt;/a&gt; custom firmware releases. Over time they developed and diverged, and were joined by a lot of other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the three biggies are DD-WRT (feature rich), OpenWRT (package-based, essentially a Linux distro for your router) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato&quot;&gt;Tomato&lt;/a&gt; (Pretty and user-friendly). Each of them let you tweak router configuration and do things you can’t do from a typical router configuration interface. So the big reasons to use one are to gain extra control, functions or analytics from your router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-firmware&quot;&gt;Which firmware?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a lot of time and (I assume) picking and choosing packages will take a bit of that, so OpenWRT is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the capacity to play and tweak, and want solid VPN configuration and performance, which makes me lean more toward DD-WRT than Tomato. Decision made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://vpncritic.com/tomato-vs-dd-wrt-vs-openwrt/&quot;&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://securerouter.org/tech-tips/dd-wrt-or-tomato-or-openwrt-or/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://vpnpick.com/dd-wrt-vs-tomato-vs-open-wrt/&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; offering comparisons so take a look and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-router&quot;&gt;Which router?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious choice is the router plugged into your wall right now. The obvious consequence of that, however, is that you’ll be out of Internet during the upgrade. Possibly longer if things don’t go to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, in my case my current router is about four years old, was cheap at the time, struggles to stream things to my Apple TV and, if it started having to tunnel all traffic through a VPN, would probably have a heart attack. All in all a good set of excuses to get a new router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time Googling, comparing and reading reviews and ended up with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netgear.com.au/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R7000.aspx?gclid=CN2VlNvCsMUCFdcjvQoduXAATA&quot;&gt;Netgear R7000 Nighthawk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; alt=&quot;Netgear R7000 Nighthawk&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015-ddwrt/nighthawk.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Netgear R7000 Nighthawk. Almost like a batmobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-ready&quot;&gt;Getting ready&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to download firmware versions and a copy of the DD-WRT installation instructions just in case things don’t go to plan. Normally this is simply a case of looking up your router in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database&quot;&gt;supported routers database&lt;/a&gt; and downloading the initial ROM and, possibly, an additional recommended ROM. It turns out the NightHawk is a special case here, however, and isn’t listed in the database. Hmmmm…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s far from unsupported. Useful documentation is still relatively prevalent, and if you look around there are loads of good resources. But the one you should pay attention to if you’re using a NightHawk (it’s updated every couple of weeks) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=264152&quot;&gt;this forum post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Installation&quot;&gt;General DD-WRT installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Tutorials&quot;&gt;General DD-WRT tutorials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/netgear-r7000-dd-wrt/&quot;&gt;Someone else’s NightHawk installation blog entry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, the ROMS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2015/&quot;&gt;ftp://ftp.dd-wrt.com/betas/2015/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.desipro.de/ddwrt-ren/K3-AC-Arm/&quot;&gt;NightHawk Only - http://www.desipro.de/ddwrt-ren/K3-AC-Arm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://desipro.de/ddwrt/K3-AC-Arm/&quot;&gt;NightHawk Only - http://desipro.de/ddwrt/K3-AC-Arm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which ROM to install isn’t so straightforward if you’re using a NightHawk and nobody seems willing to give advice. If you’re not using a NightHawk, just download whatever the supported routers database tells you to. The detailed forum post says the last build with working bridge mode was 26125, but that is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; old, and it also lists several problems fixed in February and March 2015. So what the hey, maybe the very latest build is the best idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me that’s 2015-05-19, so down it comes. As does the latest stock firmware from NetGear, just in case it all goes wrong I want to have that handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Flashing DD-WRT
Time to install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect your computer to your router with an ethernet cable and, if it’s not a brand new router, clear your web browser’s cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Log into your router’s management page, find the page to upload a new firmware version, and upload the DD-WRT initial firmware. Continue through any warnings you get and wait for the process to complete in full. Do what’s necessary for a factory reset to clear NVRAM, for the NightHawk this is easy - Just go to its management page (you’ll need to set an initial username and password first), then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; alt=&quot;Administration-Factory-defaults&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015-ddwrt/factory-restore.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Administration section, Factory Restore tab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in a reboot and you’ll need to again set an initial username and password. Configure the router as you need to, but here are some tidbits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wifi-settings&quot;&gt;WiFi settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like setting an upper-upper extension channel makes a considerable difference - I have’t yet had time to trial different combinations of settings, but this is what I’m currently using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; alt=&quot;Wireless settings&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015-ddwrt/wireless-settings.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Current wireless settings for my 5GHz interface&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-performance&quot;&gt;Testing performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Mac, you can get some useful information on your network connection by option-clicking on the wireless icon in the menu bar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; alt=&quot;Detailed wireless connection info&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015-ddwrt/wireless-status.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Detailed network connection information is available on a Mac by option-clicking the wireless icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the current connection speed is nearly 900MB/s, so I’m not too worried about testing different combinations of settings at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com&quot;&gt;developed Android applications&lt;/a&gt; will agree that the single most frustrating aspect of Android development is the painstaking poor performance and bugginess of Google’s official Android emulator. Networking and file storage don’t work as they should (I once spent about four hours debugging an issue with file storage - Turned out it was only an issue on the official emulator; other emulators and actual devices worked fine), frequent use will inevitably get you into an “insufficient storage” cycle requiring you to re-create your virtual device over and over again. And all of this in a tool that is so. slow. it. hurts. And has a serious impact on your coffee consumption thanks to the never-ending &lt;em&gt;“I’ll just grab a coffee while the emulator’s restarting”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s quite possible the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.genymotion.com&quot;&gt;Genymotion&lt;/a&gt; saved my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;centered-image&quot; src=&quot;/images/2015-genymotion/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Genymotion Logo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys have taken the AndroVM open source project, added some significant wow factor, and made it freely available for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Available on Mac, Windows and Linux&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualbox.org&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; (need to download separately on Mac, I think the VirtualBox Runner comes with the downloads for the other platforms)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brilliantly fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrates with Eclipse and AndroidStudio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did I mention how fast it was?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do your heart a favour to and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; static site processing engine as the basis for this site. I switched to Jekyll only a few months ago when, after ignoring my site for some time, I wanted to add some content and discovered that my Drupal database had been broken into and all content deleted. This came on the back of years of continued Wordpress patching (or lack of patching followed by defacing of my site), and finally I’d had enough and felt a yearning for the good old days when sites were simple and didn’t need dynamic content or databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some Googling I found Jekyll, which fit the bill perfectly and dead simple to create great-looking pages to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then came the day I wanted to add a photo gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that was dead simple too, but was an interesting process. And from the research I did I think I approached it slightly differently (and I think - of course) with slightly better results than other sites I found describing how to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-define-your-data&quot;&gt;Step 1. Define your data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a YAML data file describing your galleries in your jekyll _data directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gilli-diving&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Diving on Gilli Air&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imagefolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/images/2015-gilli&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gilli-1.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;thumb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;thumb-1.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Hanging at the bungalow drinking coconuts&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gilli-2.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;thumb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;thumb-2.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;View from our room&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;perp-anzac&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Point Perp&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imagefolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/images/2015-perp&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;perp-1.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;thumb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;thumb-1.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Brittany&apos;s first ever trad lead&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;perp-2.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;thumb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;thumb-2.jpg&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;On my way up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-add-a-galleries-link-to-your-navigation&quot;&gt;Step 2. Add a galleries link to your navigation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add an entry to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_data/navigation.yml&lt;/code&gt; directing to your galleries page (we’ll create it next).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-3-create-your-galleries-page&quot;&gt;Step 3. Create your galleries page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new page wherever your galleries link was pointing - For me that was &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/gallery/index.md&lt;/code&gt;. This page creates thumbnail links to each gallery, using a gallery image (randomised each time the site is re-generated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;---
layout: page
title: &quot;Galleries&quot;
---
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;overflow: auto;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% for gallery in site.data.galleries %}
{% assign random = site.time | date: &quot;%s%N&quot; | modulo: gallery.images.size %}
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;gallery-thumb&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ gallery.id }}.html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ gallery.description }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ gallery.description }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ gallery.imagefolder }}/{{ gallery.images[random].thumb }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ gallery.description }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ gallery.images | size }} images&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about the CSS, we’ll deal with that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-4-define-a-gallery-layout&quot;&gt;Step 4. Define a gallery layout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a (mostly-blank) markdown page for each gallery, but first we’re going to define the layout template used to display a gallery.
Create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts/gallery.html&lt;/code&gt; using something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;---
layout: page
---
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/assets/css/extra.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

{% for gallery in site.data.galleries %}
	{% if gallery.id == page.galleryid %}
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ gallery.description }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;list-gallery&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		{% for image in gallery.images %}
			&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ gallery.imagefolder }}/{{ image.name }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;itemprop=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;url&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ image.text }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ image.text }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ image.text }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ gallery.imagefolder }}/{{ image.thumb }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		{% endfor %}
		&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	{% endif %}
{% endfor %}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-5-create-your-gallery-pages&quot;&gt;Step 5. Create your gallery pages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step is trivial but, because Jekyll generates static pages, needs to be done. Create a new markdown page in your gallery’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;imagefolder&lt;/code&gt; for each gallery. My &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gallery/gilli-diving.md&lt;/code&gt;, for example, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gallery&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;galleryid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;gilli-diving&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-6-make-it-pretty&quot;&gt;Step 6. Make it pretty&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few SASS niceties largely finish things off. I created a new file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_sass/extra.scss&lt;/code&gt;, importing it into `assets/css/main.scss’ with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sass&quot; data-lang=&quot;sass&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;extra&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_sass/extra.scss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sass&quot; data-lang=&quot;sass&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%gallery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;150px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%gallery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#009999&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.list-gallery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.gallery-thumb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;%gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;vertical-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;middle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-7-add-lightbox-support&quot;&gt;Step 7. Add Lightbox support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added &lt;a href=&quot;http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/&quot;&gt;Lightbox&lt;/a&gt; support when I was initially building this, and then became extremely confused about why I had two Lightbox-like photo slideshows layered atop one another. It looks like Jekyll already comes bundled with Lightbox, making this unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Done, and it looks like &lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After spending the Easter period climbing in the Grampians Wendy and I spent some time in Indonesia, including six solid days getting our open water SCUBA qualification and doing additional dives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out my recently-purchased waterproof, shockproof camera - bought so that I’d stop leaving my camera behind or in its bag when hiking and climbing to protect it from damage - was a much more brilliant purchase than expected. Being waterproof to 30m it accompanied us snorkelling and diving, and highlights from the trip are in &lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/gilli-diving.html&quot;&gt;the gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over the ANZAC Day weekend my sisters came to visit from Sydney and the Sunshine Coast, and Brittany (Sydney-based new climber) decided we should go climbing at Point Perpendicar, on the Northern end of Jervis Bay, because she loves it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point perp is an area of stunning sea cliffs, mostly traditional climbing, and notoriously bad weather. We managed to get in three climbs before the weather turned - including Brittany leading her very first trad routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been playing with Adobe Lightroom in response to Apple pulling support for Aperture so these photos are adulterated as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gallery/perp-anzac.html&quot;&gt;A couple of shots from the morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We broke up our climbing trip with &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of walking. And to be fair, a lot of it was scoping out access to crags, but some of it (like the title shot above - The head of the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki-Mt. Cook National Park) was just very nice walking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is a short visual tour of the three (OK, 2.5) “Great Walks” we did on our trip. Short because my camera didn’t come out much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kepler-track&quot;&gt;Kepler Track&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler Track starts just South of the village of Te Anau and on the shores of Lake Te Anau, in Fiordland National Park. A flat lakeside walk at the beginning and end very much broken up by a mountain pass in the middle. About 60km long the walk is usually done in 3 or 4 days. We’d planned 3 days, with the first day starting around 4pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I spent most of my time in Te Anau wondering how on earth to pronounce it. It’s &lt;strong&gt;tea an-now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day for us was 17km into Brod Bay - It was originally going to be about 5km, but we had a tip at the DOC office that we could drive into the track further south to make the first day less silly (and, more importantly, knock the last day down from a worrying 30km). An easy and beautiful walk through Beech Forest on the side of the lake had us into Brod Bay shortly before sunset to set up camp and feast by the side of the lake, while sandflies feasted upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;View from our dinner log&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the evening we started wondering at the idea of finishing the Kepler Track early so we’d have an additional day to attempt the Routeburn Track - Camping sites on the Routeburn had booked out for the duration of our visit so we couldn’t do the full track, but an extra day would give us room to walk in for half a day and then walk out the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought walking 45km with packs, including crossing a mountain pass, seemed like a ludicrous idea - But the consequences were insignificant so we may as well give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day started and we were still enthusiastic, so off we set. The next three photos are from the walk up Luxmore Pass, unfortunately the camera didn’t come out for the remainder of the trip. But we did it, almost crawling back to the car at 9.30 that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping13.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hobbling back to the car we started driving toward Milford Sound and a campsite nearer the start of the Routeburn Track, both feeling like we’d awake too exhausted to attempt the Routeburn the next morning, but neither willing to admit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;routeburn-track&quot;&gt;Routeburn Track&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We awoke feeling surprisingly well and so, after a big breakfast and several coffees, made our way to the start of the Routeburn Track. Routeburn is a 30km end-to-end walk, so we were hoping to walk in from the Western (Fiordland) end to about the halfway point and then turn around, returning to the car that evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk started very steeply, rising high above the surrounding landscape but remaining a little below the tree line until shortly before our turnaround point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With legs more tired than usual, we decided to stop for morning tea at a slightly wide and only &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; muddy section of track. Less than two minutes after we started walking again we came upon a large, open rocky area where dozens of people had stopped to rest and take in the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped for lunch at the second hut on the track, checking the weather forecast and deciding on a plan while we were there. The main range of Routeburn lay just ahead of us, so we agreed to continue walking for about an hour in the hope that we’d approach the top of the Burn and be rewarded with sweeping views of the surrounding ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mere minutes after our agreed turnaround time we made it to the top of the range - Which, it turned out, was more or less the exact halfway point of the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;A happy - and gorgeous - couple atop Routeburn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we returned to the car we were both &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tired (again), and thankful that the next two days were scheduled to be very decadent, with an overnight cruise on Doubtful Sound being the only item on the agenda for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tongariro-northern-circuit&quot;&gt;Tongariro Northern Circuit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penultimate destination for our trip - prior to a couple of days climbing at Whanganui Bay - was a flight into Auckland and quite a long drive down to Tongariro National Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Circuit is a loop stretching a little over 60km, normally done in four days and including the Tongariro Crossing, a popular day walk passing &lt;em&gt;“Mt. Doom”&lt;/em&gt; (Mt. Ngauruhoe in real life) and some astonishing-coloured volcanic lakes (no photos of those because it was raining when we passed them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape through the crossing was very alien and barren, and the very steep Mt. Ngauruhoe nothing but a deep pile of very loose shale and various-sized rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy cloud cover rolled in on our way up Ngauruhoe and settled in for the day - We were soon facing strong alpine winds, rain and extremely low visibility - And so the only subsequent photos we got of or from Ngauruhoe were from the other side of the mountain at the end of the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-tramping/tramping3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;The climb was planned for New Year’s Day 2015 and so, naturally, we were looking for an early night to get plenty of rest in for an early start and a big day. We hadn’t &lt;strong&gt;quite&lt;/strong&gt; realised what a madhouse Queenstown became at New Year’s Eve and were pretty worried that would be impossible. But we survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were leaving the campground on New Year’s Day Wendy pointed to some snow-dusted ranges and asked if I’d noticed the snow the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It must have snowed overnight&lt;/em&gt; I respond, &lt;em&gt;At least they’re not the mountains we’re going to&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we drive my mind, gears moving slowly in the morning, realises that the Remarkables are significantly higher than that mountain range, and begins to wonder what we’ll have in store for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-remarks/remarks3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;The climb begins at the rightmost of this shot, over both peaks of Double Cone to the right before crossing to the higher Single Cone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More or less a light dusting of snow. Not so much that anything is obscured or slippery, although rock climbing like this could be mighty unpleasant. At the end of the road we follow faint tracks up the range, eventually realising we’ve gone about a kilometre in the wrong direction and turn back toward &lt;em&gt;Telecom Tower&lt;/em&gt;. The climb starts at &lt;em&gt;The Helipad&lt;/em&gt;, apparently a well-known area by climbers in the area and so we’re left to our own devices to figure out how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-remarks/remarks1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking down on Lake Alta from the track up&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-remarks/remarks2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking up to the end of the road&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On arriving at Telecom Tower we try various options to follow the range South, with the most likely being a precarious climb with significant exposure. We may have been defeated today as Wendy suggests it could be time to turn around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-remarks/remarks4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Double Cone and Single Cone. The large flat area to the right of the peaks is The Helipad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we return from Telecom Tower Wendy notices footprints worn into the snowdrift well below Telecom Tower, and following those we pass below a large chasm to the South of Telecom Tower and then gain the ridgeline and are able to walk/scramble to The Helipad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-remarks/remarks6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Lake Alta looks very different from when I was last here in Winter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we reach The Helipad, having gotten lost multiple times and been moving quite slowly because we didn’t really know where we were going, nor whether our chose direction would get us there, we’d been moving for four hours. And hadn’t yet started the actual climb. Despite long Summer days, and particularly with an unknown route of unknown difficulty ahead of us, we succumb to uncertainty, have lunch and return to the car, prepared for next time by now knowing the approach to The Helipad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-remarks/remarks7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu sitting 2000 metres below the ranges&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We return on January 6, on another clear, crisp morning, and this time reach The Helipad in around 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some exciting - but all easy - rock pitches interspersed with walking, rock scrambling or, in some cases, edging along a knifeblade ridge with about 400m of air on one side down to Lake Alta and 2000m on the other down to Queenstown make for an amazing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapping off Single Cone at the end of the day we’re thankful again for the ice tools that we used crossing the snow banks at the start - With the south face being so sheltered the snow bank was hard, slippery ice and we were forced to cut steps to make it off the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In August 2014, shortly after my sister returned from working and trekking in India and Nepal, we caught up at a family party and, along with Wendy, hatched a plan to (optimistically) Climb Mt. Aspiring at the beginning of Summer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over the next few months plans became more concrete, Wendy took a contract in the Middle East, and before we knew it Brittany and I were days away from meeting up in Queenstown to begin 10 days in the mountains. Our plans were to spend a few days teaching Brittany to be safe on snow, ice and rope, a day climbing Mt. Aspiring, a couple of days walking out and to have a few extra days up our sleeve in case of bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;29-december&quot;&gt;29 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly into Queenstown to meet Brittany, who arrived yesterday. Flight delayed nearly two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See Brittany. Visit outdoor stores for last minute gear (gas and nalgene). Way too much gear. How to make this work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 10 days food and &lt;strong&gt;lots&lt;/strong&gt; of gear (rock protection, snow protection, warm weather gear, wet weather gear, cold weather gear to the hilt, …) it’s obvious we don’t want to be walking in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;30-november&quot;&gt;30 November&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bus to Wanaka. Arrived slightly early, pick up Brittany’s hire boots from Adventure Consultants, stashed in a hiding hole, along with a tarp to wrap our bags in for them to look after, because they’re closed on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boots fit well. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phone bus to arrange transport to the helicopter hanger. Bus isn’t running today because “the driver is at the races”. Bugger. Go to DOC (Department of Conservation), ask about other buses. The only other company doesn’t answer. Call helo company anyway and come up with a plan with their help - taxi to their hanger and a shared flight at 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy hut tickets (I should really join NZAC) and food and repack, somewhat better this time. Guy Cotter (owner of Adventure Consultants) drops by while we’re waiting for our taxi at his office and asks us what we’re doing. We help him unload pot plants and make friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$70 cab ride to hanger, the other party hasn’t yet arrived but we’re early. Eventually the other party is late. Then cancelled. Bugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pilot offers us a lift into town and back out in the morning to save another pair of cab fees, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-december&quot;&gt;1 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrived at the hanger and the other party was all waiting already - We’re not being stood up this time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fly into Bonar Glacier, Brittany gets the front seat. Great flying in although my fingers freeze while gearing up in the shade and Chris gets cranky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk in to Colin Todd Hut exhausts Brittany, but at least we’re one of the first groups in so we get a bed. The hut very quickly fills up, with ours being the first of at least half a dozen flights that day due to two fine days after weeks of bad weather. People continue to flow in and people start begging to squeeze in, setting up tents, scoping out floor space and digging snow caves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Colin Todd Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a remarkable amount of snow for this time of year. We head out to the Isa Glacier for some walking and self arrest lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fun, friendly (and small) hut and we have a very early night, with lots of people in bed before 9pm to go up Aspiring early the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pore through the guidebook and decide on Rolling Pin, a Grade II/2, which a few people climbed today and were thrilled about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it turns out there aren’t stoves here and I’m now somewhat worried about how long my single gas canister will last. Dinner is chewy brown rice and crunchy split peas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-december&quot;&gt;2 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep in until 8, manage to wake Brittany and start getting ready for the climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We breakfast on muesli (cold, conserving gas). A French guide and his partner are heading out and offer us extra gas. Thank God!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climb starts common with Mt. Aspiring, walking up Shipowner Ridge. It’s pretty hard work and there are a few rests along the way. After making it to the top of the ridge we traverse the col to the West to the start of Rolling Pin. An easy first couple of ridges lead to a very scary looking steep face. “Oh well, we’ll see how far we get”, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pitches are easy, with some cool views over long steep faces and crevassed glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep pitch doesn’t look quite so steep once we’re at it so I give it a whirl. A large rock at the halfway point makes a good point to aim for to reassess whether I want to continue. I get to the rock and decide I should probably place some pro (run out about 30m above the belay). Lucky I do because the last half is a bit less solid and my feet slip a few times (but don’t fall). Somewhat concerned about the downclimb but it’s not terrible. We get to the ridge and have lots of rocks to greet us on the far side - excellent, we can rap down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Steeper than it looks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exposed, sharp ridge line for the final pitch gets us to the summit. Woo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring13.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Brittany on the summit of The Rolling Pin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We return the way we came, with big clouds blowing in. Brittany leads the down pitches and me the traverses. I lower Brittany down the steep ice face, backed up to a dodgy rock, then hesitatingly rap off the rock. Apparently I survive and we short rope the rest of the way down. We barely avoid a white out as the mountain disappears above us almost as soon as we’re back on the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the hut for celebratory water and chatting with everyone else about their day (only about 4 of about 20 people reached the summit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will likely be good weather in the morning and terrible in the afternoon. Eyeing off Mainroyal in the guidebook, II/1, plan to leave at 7pm to be back by lunch time and well and truly before the weather comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-december&quot;&gt;3 December&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Sunrise over Mt. Aspiring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave at 7 for Mainroyal and turn back after crossing the ridge to the Dipso Glacier and being met with heavy snow. Return to the hut as the Aussie group of 3 we flew in with are leaving, at 9.30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Starting to wonder about the wisdom of continuing West&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;The Aussio trio get away just ahead of the clouds - They disappear from view minutes later&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour or so later an AC group of 2 guides and 2 clients returns from the walk out - An older doctor found the Bonar too tough to walk up so they’re joining us to wait out a couple of days of bad weather in the hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat a bit to Jono through the afternoon about my trip in February and all sorts of things. He and Gabe are pretty fun. Spend most of the day reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-december&quot;&gt;4 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake to heavy rain and wind. Sit in on the AC prussiking, rope and knots lessons. I help out while Brittany learns. They feed me coffee (!!!!), the doctor makes fun of the “Isagenix cult”, and we chat about climbing. The afternoon is a navigation lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Hut days. Mountain Guide Gabriel gives a demo. &lt;a href=&quot;http://justonestep.eu&quot;&gt;justonestep.eu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-december&quot;&gt;5 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up at 4am to greet good weather and head to French Ridge Hut. We leave Colin Todd around 5.50 and the five hour walk takes about seven and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring18.jpg&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt. Avalanche sits just atop French Ridge and looks like a fun day for next time&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;French Ridge appearing through the clouds with sheer cliffs to one side and crevasses to the other&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brittany nearly pulls me into a &lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; crevasse and I lose my shit over lack of attentiveness. Mega blisters for me and sore neck for her make the rest of the walk pretty angsty. We make up over a rolled ankle a few hundred metres from the hut and Chris to the rescue. It’s obvious we’re not going any further today so we settle in (heavy rain and gales forecast for the next two days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-december&quot;&gt;6 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking, tea, puzzles, card games and teaching Brittany hut-bound crevasse rescue and hauling systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I open the door of the hut to be surprised by a guy standing there in his undies. Apparently the walk up was warm. An interesting ex-vegetarian in his mid-twenties studying IT from Chicago, the three of us chat through the afternoon and, after the forecast, decide to head back down together early the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-december&quot;&gt;7 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snooze alarm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snooze alarm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snooze alarm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell Alex we’ve decided we’re too tired today and sleep for a few extra hours. 90 minutes after he leaves a heavy downpour starts and doesn’t stop until evening. We seem to have made the right decision (although we bump into him in Wanaka a few days later and he tells us he made it out without getting wet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More reading, card games and haul systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring25.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Cabin fever setting in?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-december&quot;&gt;8 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We awake to a perfect day and a surprisingly-tough 7.5km down French Ridge. That’s 7.5km horizontal. And, I guess, about 2km vertical. Very steep going and it’s mid-afternoon by the time we get into Aspiring Hut. The hut warden kindly books a bus back to Wanaka for us (and gets lightly reprimanded for it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few group in the hut who have walked in from Raspberry Flats. One guy has nausea, vomiting, fever and stopped sweating during the day. After we convince him to take rehydration salts and get some water bottles around him to cool him Brittany and I discuss weather it’s heat &lt;em&gt;exhaustion&lt;/em&gt; or heat &lt;em&gt;stroke&lt;/em&gt;. The strange ways we entertain ourselves…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring22.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring23.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-december&quot;&gt;9 December&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any easy, flat, fast and beautiful stroll out to Raspberry Flats and we’re checking into a backpackers’, anxiously awaiting a shower, by lunch time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-aspiring/aspiring24.jpg&quot; /&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;Despite spending a significant portion of my latest trip to NZ in bed sick with, variously, a flue, chest infection and asthma, there was still a good deal of extraordinary scenery and I keep inflicting the photos on people. Some people, strangely, have actually been asking to see the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s a quick flick through the rare moments of 9 days ice and mixed climbing when I remembered to get my camera out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Christchurch the first task was to get a rental car and drive south. While Queenstown was our destination we first stopped in Wanaka for a night because … Well, because I love Wanaka. There’ll be a sole photo of Wanaka later, but the drive South passed Lake Tekapo for our first stark reminder that we’re back in the Eastern state. Or we’ve returned from the West island. Whichever way around you say it, the mountains are unmatched by anything in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On arriving in Queenstown I called one of the other Aussies I knew was in town for the festival and discovered we were staying at the same place. He was just about to go ‘dry tooling’ with two other people from Canberra, so I introduced myself and invited myself along.
Dry tooling is where you use ice tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a dry environment (i.e. on rock, not ice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out dry tooling is fantastic. It’s just like hard rock climbing but, instead of having to deal with hand/finger holds that are so minute a one year-old couldn’t fit more than a fingernail on them, using the ice pick gives you a great big handle to hang on to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Teagan - a friend who came along for the ride - attempting the great cave traverse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Me on the cave traverse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ice and Mixed Festival started the following day so of course we were greeted with severe gale force winds, blizzard conditions, road closures and advice to avoid the climbing areas because the ski resorts were throwing explosives out of helicopters in their vicinity to trigger avalanches. So we found some unclimbed ice- and snow-covered rocks not too far from the ski resort buildings (and so safe from explosives) and spent the day climbing on a mixture of snow, ice and rock there. No photos because I was having too much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of the festival, vastly improved weather and I’d convinced the guys running the ice climbing clinic to take us out to Single Cone - I’d been reading about the ‘South Face Classic’ in the lead-up to the trip - a 400ish metre section of moderately difficult water ice climbing running down the Southern face of Single Cone. I woke at 6am feeling absolutely terrible but convinced myself to get up for the trip to Single Cone. After a 2.5-hour or so trudge through knee-deep snow on tricky terrain we got there and I realised I should have stayed in bed. Not only did I feel terrible but it was a zoo out there, with a group of 10 beating our group of 12 to the ice cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, once I started climbing I felt a whole lot better. Until I stopped climbing. And being on the South face we were completely shielded from the sun all day so the ambient temperature was about -15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abandoning the night’s festivities I was in bed by 8pm that night, where I stayed for about 32 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later I ventured out for more dry-tooling, and the 15-minute, fairly flat walk out absolutely exhausted me. But I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; manage to finally complete the grade M8 (i.e. extremely difficult) cave traverse and lead climb several moderate (grade M3/M4) routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Brendan - A fellow Australian - on the grade M4 route I also led&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allure of more ice climbing was too great to resist so, still feeling terrible, lacking any stamina, and coughing so much I was coughing up blood and had continually sore abdominals, I somewhat cautiously decided to join a group heading to ‘Alta Ice’ on the outskirts of Lake Alta, this time only about 5km from the Remarkables ski resort and - critically - on an Eastern aspect so the clear and sunny forecast would warm us rather than mock us as it did at Single Cone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a difference a couple of days rest (and a lovely sunny day) can make! The walk uphill from the ski resort to Alta Pass was tough, but just tough enough to warm us up and make us drop down to just a couple of layers of clothes and a single pair of gloves. From there we crossed the frozen Lake Alta (possibly the scariest part of the day, hoping the ice was thick enough to take my weight) and started zigzagging up the great big hill to the ice cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Walking up from Lake Alta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little under 2 hours we made it to Alta Ice and were greeted by our targets. The three most significant waterfalls in the area are 30m (the left two) and 60m (the rightmost) in height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enthusiastically jumped straight on ‘Alta Ego’, the middle route, but got nervous by a very soft (snowy) vertical section that seemed both quite difficult and impossible to protect a fall from with any degree of safety, and abandoned the climb after about 20m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf13.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily there was a better/braver/crazier climber in the group who completed the climb&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather stayed remarkable for the walk back in the afternoon. Apt, I suppose, since we were in the Remarkables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this stage in the trip most people were losing energy and one of the other Canberrans was trying to find a climbing partner to climb a 250m moderately difficult mixed ice/snow/rock route. After a little coercion (I was feeling pretty unwell after the walk back from Alta Ice) I realised that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It sounded like an amazing climb, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be my last opportunity for mixed climbing until next Winter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We awoke early to low-lying clouds and a questionable low pressure system, but drove up the mountain to have a coffee at the ski resort, study the weather and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the ski resort carpark we could almost, but not quite, make out the path halfway up the hill we needed to follow to cross to the western side of the range, where our climb was waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 90 minutes studying the weather, forecast and coffee we decided retreat was the best part of valour and instead enjoyed a sunny day rock climbing in Queenstown on the shores of Lake Wakatipu. When we returned from climbing at 3pm there was still a large cloud system covering the top of the Remarkables (right where we’d be climbing), so we’d obviously made the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day it was time to take a bus back to Christchurch in preparation for the trip home. The bus took a detour via Wanaka and I couldn’t resist snapping a quick shot of Aspiring National Park looming behind Lake Wanaka. The leftmost snow-covered peak is Mt. Aspiring, New Zealand’s third-highest peak standing at about 3100m, affectionately known as ‘The Matterhorn of the South’, with its summit looming 1.3 vertical kilometres out of the crevassed Bonar Glacier and the focus of my next trip, tentatively planned at this stage for November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-nzimf/nzimf18.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have been one of the not-quite-fifty NSW SES members accredited in Alpine Search and Rescue, and in early 2013 began looking for ways to improve my skills and increase the capability of the programme beyond what it currently held. With other operators having previously travelled to Canada to undertake advanced snowmobile training international travel was certainly feasible so my attention was naturally drawn to alpine offerings in New Zealand. This was both a professional and personal pursuit as a natural progression from my rock climbing and alpine hiking and, while I was prepared to pay for mountaineering-specific training myslf, I was able to secure funding for six alpine operators through a combination of the NSW SES Volunteers’ Association and the budget of the NSW SES Alpine programme itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Following the trip attendees prepared a trip report for publication in the quarterly Volunteer magazine outlining the activities and outcomes of the trip. This is a copy of the trip report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSW SES Alpine Search and Survival (ASAS) operators are tasked to assist police in searches and recoveries in Australian alpine areas. Such tasks are rarely on blue sky days, and more likely in challenging white out and blizzard conditions where one’s next step can result in being up to the waist in water or undergrowth, or skidding down a slope. In these conditions communication is sometimes only possible by hand signals and navigation a constant and difficult challenge. Keeping warm means avoiding sweating as well as not getting cold and enough equipment must be carried to survive a night in a possibly wet winter snow environment. It takes experience and training to function effectively as an ASAS team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ten day course in New Zealand was undertaken by ASAS operators in February-March 2014. Six members attended the course: 2 from Queanbeyan unit, 2 from Snowy River unit, 1 from Khancoban unit and 1 from Tumut unit. The overall purpose of the course was to increase skills in operating, traveling and rescue in alpine areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was organised through Adventure Consultants, a reputable company that organises many expeditions to all parts of the world. The ASAS party was assigned two instructors accredited with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations (IFMGA) who were to facilitate the course, do the training, assess risks and ensure safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial meeting in Wanaka on the first morning was to define the course goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Snow and ice personal and group skills&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Group management skills&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vertical ice and climbing awareness&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal safety and self-arrest on ice and snow&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining physical capability in challenging environments&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Environmental awareness&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low light and white out navigaion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glacier travel, crevasse identification and crossing (being reuired for safe operation in our traiing area, and applicable to our creeks and rivers)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avalanche threat identification&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rescue skills: formal and improvised, in particular, ice and snow anchors, rigging mechanical advantage, extracting oneself from a system under tension, crevasse and avalanche rescue techniques&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food and equipment were organised and in the early afternoon the group left Wanaka for the Aoraka (Mt. Cook) area. The group visited the search and rescue base at Aoraki, learnt about their call out and operational procedures, the gear they used and their emergency management protocols, which were not so different from a NSW SES operations centre. We left Mt. Cook Search And Rescue with some insights and ideas mostly related to cliff rescue and which the vertical rescue operators in the group are looking forward to bringing into the soon to be established NSW SES Vertical Rescue Capability Development Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night was spent at Unwin Lodge, near the Aoraki airport, with some initial familiarisation and skill checking, the guides and the group began to get each other’s measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning the group was helicoptered to Plateau Hut, high on a prominence above the confluence of three glaciers, well away from avalanche risk and close under Aoraki and several other peaks, a location called “The Grand Plateau”. This was to be the base for the course. The hut is new since 2005, the third in that location, large and Spartan but comfortable with solar powered lights and propane gas stoves and a very large refrigerator anywhere you would care to look outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz1.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not the climbing season due largely to the danger of avalanches and uncovered crevasses, so the ASAS group had the hut to themselves for the duration of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vertical scale of the region is much greater than in Australia. Plateau Hut is at 2215m, with mountains towering above it; Mt. Kosciuszko by contrast is 2228m high. The glaciated environment is significantly different from the alpine areas in Australia, dangers and opportunities rare and distributed in Australia are concentrated here so it is an excellent training ground. Like the environment the weather was varied; some days of high wind and snow and cold, some with brilliant sunshine and summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first exercise was self arrest: The art, should one trip or fall, of stopping one’s accelerating progress towards oblivion, even downhill head first on one’s back, with presence of mind, quick reaction and an ice axe. The second exercise was an excursion into a crevasse field, appropriately roped up, to learn at close hand the pitfalls and their avoidance in such an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz2.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather closed in for a few days, allowing the group to experience low light, white out conditions, high wind and cold. The group trekked to the not so nearby Cinerama Coloir suparating the Anzac Peaks (appropriately named given our party) from Aoraki. It was a physically taxing trek involving pre-planned and in-the-field navigation mediated by the need to find safe routes amongst crevasses and the low light and low contrast conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz3.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another day, the group was introduced to the curious sport of lowering into a crevasse and then ascending using prusik cords to get out, passing several knots on the way. The guides thoughtfully selected a “bottomless” crevasse for this exercise. On the last afternoon of the trip we extended this experience: The group paired up, a rope joining each of the pair. Each of the pair in turn literally jumped into the pit on a rope, hoping to be arrested by their colleague at the other end of the rope. The person not dangling then had to construct a snow anchor while holding their colleague on the rope, release themselves from the system and rig a hauling system to extract their colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz4.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another exercise was a tour through a tumble of ice cliffs and crevasses on the Linda Glacier, a lesson on ice anchors using ice screws and Abalakov anchors, culminating in an ice climb. This provided insight into the equipment, techniques and challenges faced by the small community of our potential clients who congregate at Blue Lake in Kosciuszko National Park every Winter to partake in Australia’s ice climbing offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz5.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the poor-weather days was put to good use in training for avalanche awareness, search and recovery. The group spent the morning covering avalanche theory: The different types of avalanche, the risk factors, and in-field identification of avalanches and avalanche terrain. There were not-infrequent reminders of the avalanche danger that could be heard and occasionally seen in the surrounding mountains. This was followed by practice locating avalanche transceivers, at first inside the hut and later competing for the fastest time to locate avalanche beacons buried in the snow. The day ended with a scenario involving three buried “victims” and requiring both a transceiver search and an avalanche probe line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this training the ASAS programme will be stepping up its training in avalanche awareness and search and recovery in 2014, with avalanches being a rare but real risk in the Australian alps due to the increasing popularity of back country travel, in particular skiers, snowboarders and climbers seeking steep cliffs and cornices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz6.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon before the group was due to leave the weather cleared, and the challenge changed from staying warm to keeping cool. It is on this afternoon we did the crevasse rescues described earlier. The final morning dawned fine as well, the group was split into two sets of four, each comprising two pairs on one rope. There are two small peaks near to the hut, each group climbed both peaks in opposite order, which involved abseiling, ice and rock climbing, and lead climbing for some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz7.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz8.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we flew out from the hut for another night at Unwin Lodge and a celebratory dinner at the Aoraki Hermitage Hotel. The following day we returned to Wanaka. There, we had a lecture on avalanche-related issues and were all on a plane back to Australia the day after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz9.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each evening during the course and also during some days when we could not safely venture out the guides showed us an extensive variety of rope techniques useful for search and rescue parties carrying limited equipment, informed us on many subjects including weather theory, improvised shelters, first aid, improvised alpine harnesses and resources available that support alpine adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an intense course where each participant learnt a lot, was challenged to their limits regardless of the experience they brought to the course, and were affirmed in their existing skills. The participants are eager to pass on new knowledge and techniques acquired directly and to adapt techniques so they will have relevance in Australian alpine conditions. A good example of this is glacier travel and crevasse rescue: While we lack crevasses in Australia, we have an abundance of rock formations with caves and swiftly-flowing rivers and creeks that become covered by snow. These pose as much of a risk as crevasses and require a quick response by rescuers, so developing techniques and recommending equipment for safer travel and to mediate high risk situations in our alpine environment is a goal for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/asas-nz/nz10.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Participants: Chris Bennetts-Cash, Dan Philippa, Brent Bowen, Simon McGinn, Yvette Amos, Bill Taylor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Guides: Andy Cole and Mark Austin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At 6pm on December 20, 2013 a ute pulled over at Dead Horse Gap, in the Southern part of Kosciuszko National Park and just South of Thredbo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Three Canberrans got out of the ute and walked to the start of the bush. A few minutes later a sole person returned to the ute and drove back to Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is the journal I kept as we walked the 250km back to Canberra along the Northern third of the Australian Alpine Walking Track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Our packs are fatter than us as we prepare to set out&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-0&quot;&gt;Day 0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to Dead Horse around 1800 so decided to get the big hill out of the way in dusk. 9.9km later stopped at Rawson’s Pass. May not have been allowed to camp within 200m of the pass but we were 200m from the toilet and that seemed good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairly warm night, rain came up when we went to bed but wind had dried it by morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;This is probably (possibly?) South Ram&apos;s Head from the Dead Horse Gap track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;After walking up Dead Horse Gap in Winter 2012 I swore I&apos;d never do it again. How did I end up here?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Once atop the Gap it was smooth sailing into Rawson&apos;s Pass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;A nice (if potentially clandestine) camping spot at the foot of Mt. Kosciuszko&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead Horse to White’s River. &lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; Schlink as planned. Killer day. &lt;strong&gt;So&lt;/strong&gt; much more mountainous than I’d anticipated. And &lt;strong&gt;so much&lt;/strong&gt; of it untracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we eventually arrived at White’s River Hut we discussed whether to bail on the trip. After talking through bailing, bailing at Kiandra and attempting to continue, we decided to continue. After all, what are PLB’s for … Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fell asleep while Dani cooked dinner. Ate and slept again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rodent holes in my pack: 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heels with bilsters: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;The stunning Main Range. It&apos;s amazing being up here&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt8.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt9.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Lake Albina&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;More snow than I expected for Christmas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;White&apos;s River Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to Grey Mare Hut, 16.8km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injuries: Right knee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checked out Valentine’s Hut en route, gorgeous! Adorned with love hearts, very quaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt13.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Valentine&apos;s Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful scenery, good trail. Skipped Valentine’s Falls to avoid more arduous terrain after yesterday. Some sadist had put the hut 500m away from the trail up a damn big hill. And the toilet another 50m uphill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Grey Mare Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old gold mine is here with machinery and irrigation left behind, but I couldn’t find the mine entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to Mackay’s Hut today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word on the street is it’s pronounced “Mackey’s”, and often spelled that way too - albeit incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injuries: None, but it turns out, with enough rain, canvas rucksacks aren’t actually waterproof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cool start to the day gave a lovely morning, then it started raining lightly. That was also quite nice at first. Morning tea at O’Keefe’s Hut - very beautiful, lined with 1936 newspaper and housing a sparrow nest and pair of sparrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt18.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got drenched between O’Keefe’s and Mackay’s when a pleasant sprinkle (not wearing goretex) turned into heavy rain and eventually &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; heavy rain. And we got drenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started a decent fire in the hut and got our things dry. Dining table dinner by the fire with rock salt and freshly ground pepper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt19.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Drying wet clothes, gear and pack in a steaming hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerned the rain will block further river crossings to the North. It clears before dinner. But it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; very heavy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt20.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Mackay&apos;s Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4&quot;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s destination is 4 Mile Hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injuries: Chris gets gastro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attacks by hordes of ants: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gastro Stop is amazing stuff!! Otherwise a fairly uneventful day. Had planned to set camp at 9 Mile Creek but were attacked by ants. Not just a little bit attacked. Every time something goes on the ground its colour changes to mostly black attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some bloody ants bit the bloody part of my blister (which I’d kicked into a rock washing myself at the gold mine and made bleed). And that bloody hurt. So on we went after grabbing desperately-needed water to 4 Mile Hut. Very cute original-style gold miner’s hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt21.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Nothing but trail as far as the eye can see&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt22.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-5&quot;&gt;Day 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;christmas&quot;&gt;Christmas!!!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…And on to Witses Hut&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt23.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Christmas dawns to the most amazing sunrise I&apos;ve ever seen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injuries: Dani gets gastro, and bonks a couple of km from the hut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uneventful walk in, Chris spends 90 minutes chopping firewood for the crazy-cold mornings while Dani snoozes. Very good looking hut, but made of timber slabs with gaps between them so neither fly-proof nor insulated. We manage to keep the fire going all night by not sleeping very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt24.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Old town hall at Kiandra along the way&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt25.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Witses Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-6&quot;&gt;Day 6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Hainsworth Hut&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injuries: None (?!?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top up water as soon as we find it (both water sources at Witses were either dry or too shallow to get drinking water).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt26.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Also a large herd of brumbies as we set out for the day. They may be pests but they&apos;re beautiful&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting our shoes on after crossing the Tantangara River a 4WD approaches and we chat to some fly fishermen who are out for the day. They agree to send Craig a message for us since we’ve been unable to get phone reception. &lt;strong&gt;YAY!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get distracted by random foot trails all through the untracked section and double back a bit. Dani gets pooped so I steal her food and water for the 5km before lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I get pooped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch at Ghost Gully where several people are hanging around with lots of horsies. I say g’day to one guy as he walks nearby and get nothing in return. That’s a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt27.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Still more endless trails&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 3.5km to the hut is fairly easy and we arrive about 1410ish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hut has no saw or toilet but the river is a beautiful temperature so the first order of business is to wash our clothes and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt28.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Hainsworth Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain sets in long and hard early evening and, with a less-than-waterproof fireplace, the battle between fire and water commences. A fairly sleepless night and further gastro for Dani sees the night close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt29.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;A misty morning adds atmosphere to the seclusion&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-7&quot;&gt;Day 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oldfield’s Hut - My old friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injuries: Does a slight graze and a bit of bleeding to my right Achilles from Dani chopping firewood onto me qualify?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;freezing&lt;/strong&gt; morning sees us get away slightly later - 0710 - and power through to Bill Jones Hut for morning tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt30.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt31.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Bill Jones Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful scenery and the lovely smell of Eucalypt forest after rain but an otherwise uneventful day until the godawful slog up the start of Murray Gap trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt32.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;When Mt. Bimberi appears in the distance we know we&apos;re getting close to the end&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrived at Oldfield’s Hut 1310, found dubious water in a barely-running stream, chopped firewood (well, Dani did the vast majority of that while I supervised) and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt34.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Oldfield&apos;s Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very satisfying to be mere kilometres from the ACT border!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2013-aawt/aawt33.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt. Bimberi from Oldfield&apos;s Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apparently that’s all that I wrote. 
To ease the suspense: We got out alive, although quite tired after the big day from Oldfield’s Hut to the Orrorral Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;d-day-minus-5-weeks&quot;&gt;D-Day minus 5 weeks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my employer I have too much leave. I’ve been directed to take four weeks off before the beginning of June, and as a result will be taking all of May off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What on earth to do with all this time off? Caddy has an exhibition opening in Melbourne in the last week of May, and I’ve been talking about doing a long distance bicycle ride a bit over the past nine months or so. So the obvious answer seems to be a bike ride from Canberra to Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of experimentation with Google Maps results in the following itinerary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Canberra - Gundagai - 154km&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gundagai - Holbrook - 117km&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Holbrook - Wodonga - 70km&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wodonga - Benalla - 110km&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Benalla - Seymour - 103km&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seymour - Melbourne - 111km&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total - 665km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this possible? My longest ride to date has been a little over 140km, but I figure if I maintain a relatively low speed of about 25km/h and be sure to stay aerobic the whole time I should be able to keep going indefinitely. And worst case I have very slow days with lots of breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I need to do before I embark on my first ever long distance ride?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure my legs can handle it. Use the ANZAC Day long weekend as a chance to do four consecutive 110km+ rides. If I can survive four days I’m sure I can survive six, particularly with a short 70km day in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to take things with me. Being a pretty fancy bike I don’t have any braze-ons to attach a rack, and the idea of attaching a trailer to a racing bike seems a bit … improper. So I need to figure out a way to jury-rig a rack and get panniers that are big enough to carry my floor pump and a lot of spare tubes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to take enough calories with me. Over long rides I average about 29kCal/km. So this ride will be 3000+kCal per day, bringing my daily calorie needs to about 5000kCal. Which is an awful lot. I’ve never been terribly concerned about calorie intake on my longer rides to date, being satisfied with about 150kCal an hour, or a 2500kCal deficit at the end of a ride. This isn’t going to be sensible over six days of cycling, and nutrition will become a pretty major consideration. Roughly, this equates to 193 energy gels, or about 5.75L of the sticky stuff, if I want to stay calorie neutral. In addition to a regular diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d-day-minus-25-weeks&quot;&gt;D-Day minus 2.5 weeks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post ANZAC Day long weekend. Successfully completed 445km over four days. Due to wind and rain on day two this included 110km on my indoor roller trainer, which resulted in day 3 beginning very hesitatingly on tired and sore hamstrings (you can’t stop pedalling on rollers). Felt tired but good at the end of day four, which bodes well for my ability to last an extra couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2010-bike/bike.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d-day-minus-1-week&quot;&gt;D-Day minus 1 week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of my first week of leave. Still not 100% certain I’m going to do this thing, but I’ve now bought a rack and a pair of panniers so I’m at least semi-committed. A couple of hours of Googling and I’ve identified accommodation at the towns I’d planned to stop at, but still not sufficiently convinced that this isn’t an absurd idea to actually book the accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this week was a build week - With no work I set a schedule of a full time triathlete, with somewhere between 25 and 30 hours of training. Focusing on the bike, of course. I could grow to love more weeks like this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d-day-minus-3-days&quot;&gt;D-Day minus 3 days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodation booked. 2.5 litres of energy gel made. Not much chance of turning back now. Weigh-in on the luggage is just under 15kg, reconsidering the contents to pack as little as possible and I’ve come up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tubes x6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tyre levers x2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rubber cement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patches x6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superglue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Floor pump&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CO2 canister x3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CO2 inflator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spanner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Light&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bike lock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phone charger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Printed directions for each leg&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ziplock bags (directions, phone, wallet = 3 )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toothbrush&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toothpaste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aussie Butt Cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calcium, magnesium, iron, multivitamins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Razor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sunscreen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cash (4x$20)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knicks x3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jerseys x3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socks x6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arm warmers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leg warmers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shoe covers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balaclava&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thermal top x2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thermal pants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boxers x3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thick socks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shoes (squash and tie together old runners)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;T-shirt x3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pants x2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d-day-sunday-may-16&quot;&gt;D-Day. Sunday, May 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for my longest ride ever. At the beginning of my longest stretch of cycling ever. It still seems pretty silly, but getting Caddy to drive me to Yass to start the journey seems like a bit of a cop-out. 158km from Gungahlin to Gundagai. I dealt with it fairly capably, with a short break for real food (a sandwich) about 4 hours into the 6 hour ride.
On arrival at Gundagai River Caravan Park I discovered that the clamps attaching my rack to the seat stay on my bike’s frame had slipped down the frame and were chipping away at the welds on the frame. After a short time panicking and considering calling Caddy for a rescue I confirmed that the weld was structurally sound, cut up a spare tube and wrapped the seat stay in rubber to protect it and prevent slippage.
With repairs completed I showered (this was soon to become a highlight of my days), cleaned my tyres, stretched and ate a tremendous amount before wondering what I should do next. After spending a couple of hours reading H.P. Lovecraft’s ‘Call of Cthulu’ on my iPhone I walked into town to find more food.
A cold night on an uncomfortable bed followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2010-bike/bike1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday-may-17&quot;&gt;Monday, May 17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan for today is 116km from Gundagai to Holbrook. After about 75km I was seriously fatigued and had another food break. With Caddy at work calling her for a rescue was a pretty embarrassing option (You may have realised by now that my ANAC weekend test ride was done &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; luggage. Oops.), so after a good stretch I completed the last 40km to Holbrook.
After checking into my motel, cleaning my tyres and, most importantly, showering I gave a generous donation to the Holbrook Bakery and spent some quality eating time walking around the museum and submarine. After getting some fruit (and, I admin, chips) from the supermarket I walked back to the motel and read while eating more. Shortly after this I walked back into town for a pub dinner. After about ten minutes discussing what ‘vegan’ meant I found myself with a massive bowl of veggies and another bowl full of hot chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2010-bike/bike2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2010-bike/bike3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday-may-18&quot;&gt;Tuesday, May 18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I cross the border! A short day (74km) today, and only 2.5 hours got me into Wodonga. After discovering there really isn’t much to do in Wodonga I spent a long afternoon sitting in the sun drinking tea and coffee and reading more Lovecraft. I’ve now passed the halfway point of my trip, which feels pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2010-bike/bike4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday-may-19&quot;&gt;Wednesday, May 19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;109km today takes me to Benalla. A mostly uneventful ride ended by being forced off the narrow highway running from the Hume Freeway into Benalla when two semis passed me travelling in opposite directions. The resulting couple of metres cycling on gravel made me regret having 23mm racing tyres as I fishtailed before getting the bike back under control.
The all-important shower and tyre-cleaning is followed by a short cycle into town and the discovery of delicious date scones at a local bakery. Walking around the town I discover that Benalla is famous not only for being the town of Caddy’s birth but also for having something to do with Ned Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2010-bike/bike5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;...A less-interesting stretch of freeway&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday-may-20&quot;&gt;Thursday, May 20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temptation to forego my vegan diet for the sake of delicious calories hit me when the owner of the Benalla caravan park told me they served complimentary pancakes for breakfast, but I managed to motivate myself to get on the road before they started cooking and avoid the allure of a hot breakfast.
105km into Seymour today, during which I realised that my impression of Canberra to Melbourne being more or less entirely downhill was perhaps a little incorrect. Eventually, after about four hours of continual rolling hills, I made it into Seymour.
The once-more obligatory shower and tyre-cleaning was followed by an uneventful but enjoyable wander around the streets of Seymour. As the afternoon grew cold and it began drizzling I realised how lucky I’d been for the entire trip, with just about perfect weather every day.
A slightly frustrating afternoon trying to find decent vegan food ended with some hot chips (perfect for the cold, rainy weather) and take away Chinese followed by an evening listening to a Cory Doctorow audiobook and figuring out how to install a C compiler on my iPhone (my mind was obviously starting to tire of not having any technical challenges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2010-bike/bike6.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday-may-21&quot;&gt;Friday, May 21&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up today was a little depressing, realising that the relaxing (mentally) and adventurous (visiting new towns every day) days were coming to an end, with today taking me the final 100km into Melbourne.
After yesterday’s endless rolling hills I was initially heartened to find that the road to Melbourne was mostly flat. Unfortunately it happened to be blowing an absolute gale on Friday morning. And not in a direction that would make me happy.
After temptations to stop for a break at every service station along the way (which I avoided), and temptations to get on a train to Melbourne at the two or three train stations I passed (also avoided…just) I eventually arrived at a sign announcing “Welcome to Melbourne”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this was a second sign, this one labelled “Melbourne 34km”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not happy. Obviously getting tired.
But before too long I was cycling with the traffic through the busy streets of Melbourne, and after a couple of stops to check my route sheet and figure out where I was going I’d reached my destination.
Once there it struck me that, after a 665km ride, my “epic” 140ish km weekend rides seemed a bit pathetic, and I began wondering what I could do next - 840km to Coffs Harbour? 1500km to the Sunshine Coast? We’ll see…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###The stats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distance: 660.88km&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time: 25-26 hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calories while riding: 14 472kCal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy gel: About 900mL, or 3000kCal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peanut butter/vegemite wholemeal sandwiches: 3 loaves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total weight: 9.9kg (bike) + 64kg (me) + ~15kg (luggage - varied with food and water) + 1.5kg (water bottles) = ~90.4kg&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audiobooks consumed: 3 (About 28 hours)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Podcasts consumed: &amp;gt;100&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Punctures: 0 (Made up for by four during my first week back at work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
