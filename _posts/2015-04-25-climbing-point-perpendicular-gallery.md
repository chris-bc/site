Over the ANZAC Day weekend my sisters came to visit from Sydney and the Sunshine Coast, and Brittany (Sydney-based new climber) decided we should go climbing at Point Perpendicar, on the Northern end of Jervis Bay, because she loves it there.

Point perp is an area of stunning sea cliffs, mostly traditional climbing, and notoriously bad weather. We managed to get in three climbs before the weather turned - including Brittany leading her very first trad routes.

I've also been playing with Adobe Lightroom in response to Apple pulling support for Aperture so these photos are adulterated as expected.
