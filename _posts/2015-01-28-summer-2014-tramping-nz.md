> We broke up our climbing trip with **a lot** of walking. And to be fair, a lot of it was scoping out access to crags, but some of it (like the title shot above - The head of the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki-Mt. Cook National Park) was just very nice walking.

## Kepler Track
The Kepler Track starts just South of the village of Te Anau and on the shores of Lake Te Anau, in Fiordland National Park. A flat lakeside walk at the beginning and end very much broken up by a mountain pass in the middle. About 60km long the walk is usually done in 3 or 4 days. We'd planned 3 days, with the first day starting around 4pm.

> I spent most of my time in Te Anau wondering how on earth to pronounce it. It's **tea an-now**.

The first day for us was 17km into Brod Bay - It was originally going to be about 5km, but we had a tip at the DOC office that we could drive into the track further south to make the first day less silly (and, more importantly, knock the last day down from a worrying 30km). An easy and beautiful walk through Beech Forest on the side of the lake had us into Brod Bay shortly before sunset to set up camp and feast by the side of the lake, while sandflies feasted upon us.

During the evening we started wondering at the idea of finishing the Kepler Track early so we'd have an additional day to attempt the Routeburn Track - Camping sites on the Routeburn had booked out for the duration of our visit so we couldn't do the full track, but an extra day would give us room to walk in for half a day and then walk out the same way.

I thought walking 45km with packs, including crossing a mountain pass, seemed like a ludicrous idea - But the consequences were insignificant so we may as well give it a shot.

The next day started and we were still enthusiastic, so off we set. The next three photos are from the walk up Luxmore Pass, unfortunately the camera didn't come out for the remainder of the trip. But we did it, almost crawling back to the car at 9.30 that night.
