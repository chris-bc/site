After spending the Easter period climbing in the Grampians Wendy and I spent some time in Indonesia, including six solid days getting our open water SCUBA qualification and doing additional dives.

It turned out my recently-purchased waterproof, shockproof camera - bought so that I'd stop leaving my camera behind or in its bag when hiking and climbing to protect it from damage - was a much more brilliant purchase than expected. Being waterproof to 30m it accompanied us snorkelling and diving, and highlights from the trip are in [the gallery](/gallery/gilli-diving.html).
